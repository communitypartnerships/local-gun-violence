Firearms, and their lethality, leave little to no chance for intervention. A moment of crisis can generate a permanent loss. The framing of firearm suicide often focuses on mental health; however, it can also be viewed through the lens of accessibility to lethal means."

    "text": "Who is Impacted?\nEighty-seven percent of firearm suicide victims are men. For men, the risk increases with age, with especially high rates among men aged 55 and older.7 The suicide rate among Veterans is significantly high and increasing – nearly 75 percent of veteran suicides involved guns.8\nSuicide rates vary by race and ethnicity, with American Indian and Alaskan Native men experiencing the highest rates (42.6 deaths per 100,000 population), followed by white men (28 deaths per 100,000 population) and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander men (19.5 deaths per 100,000 population).9\nWhile the firearm suicide rate among young people ages 10 to 24 is lower than for older cohorts, it is increasing. Gun suicide rates are the highest for American Indian and Alaskan Natives, white, and Black youth; and the rates have increased the fastest among Black, Latinx, and Asian and Pacific Islander youth.10 Among younger populations (ages 10-24), as well, about 90 percent of firearm suicides are committed by males.\nLGBTQ+ youth also have increased vulnerability. Research undertaken by the Trevor Project in 2024 reported that 39 percent of all LGBTQ+ young people seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year. Those who reported the presence of a firearm in their home were more more likely (at 43%) to have considered suicide compared to those with no access to a firearm (37%).11\nSuicide rates in rural areas have long been higher than those in urban areas, and the rural-urban difference has widened over time. Among men, firearms were the most frequent method of death by suicide in both urban and rural regions; in 2018, the firearm-related suicide rate for men in rural areas was 18.1 (deaths per 100,000 population) and in urban areas it was 11.5.12\nHaving access to a firearm increases one’s chance of dying by suicide threefold, meaning that those who own or have access to a gun are especially at risk.13 Access to gun ownership varies considerably, with men, rural residents, and white residents more likely to own or have access to a gun within the household.14"

Those who survive suicide may experience serious injuries that impact their long-term health and economic security.15 Loved ones and friends may be addressing prolonged grief, shock, anger, and guilt.16 The stigma attached to suicide can inhibit reaching out for support.17 Relatives of those who’ve died by suicide are at a higher risk of suicidal ideation and behavior.18\nSuicide exacts a financial toll as well. Research estimates that suicide and attempted suicide cost over $500 billion annually, including medical costs and work loss costs along with statistical value of lost lives estimates.19 The profound emotional toll, heightened mental health risks, and significant economic burden of suicide highlight the far-reaching consequences of this tragedy, emphasizing the critical need for prevention, intervention and support for those affected."

    "section": "Causes",
    "text": "Causes\nSuicide is a complex issue, influenced by the interaction of risk and protective factors at the individual, community, and environmental levels. At the individual level, risk factors include mental health conditions, substance use disorders, physical illness.20 Many people who die by suicide, though, have no known mental or physical health conditions.21 Negative life events – job‑related stress, financial or legal problems, family relationship ruptures – also commonly precede suicidal ideation and behavior.22 At the community level, research points to loneliness and a lack of social support, intense stressful events, and exposure to another’s death by suicide.23\nBroader environmental and societal factors further shape the risk landscape. Variation in the accessibility, availability, and acceptability of mental health care services between rural and urban regions is thought to contribute to the higher rate of firearm suicide in rural spaces, with rural populations experiencing both more difficulty accessing care and more stigma associated with seeking and receiving care.24\nOne of the most influential environmental risk factors for suicide is access to lethal means, particularly firearms. Research has consistently linked firearm availability and risk of suicide at the individual level25 and at the state-level.26 While inferring causality is complicated, a review of literature by RAND concluded that the research is “consistent with the conclusion that gun availability increases the risk of suicide.”27"

    "text": "Our Local Context\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the greater Charlottesville region, local suicide trends closely mirror national patterns, reflecting similar demographics and risk factors. Between 2018 and 2023, 76 percent of all firearm deaths in the Blue Ridge Health District were suicides and 86 percent of these deaths were of men.\nLocally, non-Hispanic white residents made up the vast majority of those who died by firearm suicide. The deaths across 2018-2023 translate to a rate of about 10 per 100,000 population, at least twice as high as any other racial or ethnic subpopulation.\nIn a shift from national trends, the percent of deaths due to suicide by firearm was as high among men aged 15-24 and 25-34 as it was among men aged 65-74 and 75-84 in the BRHD. This relative parity across age groups may reflect a generational shift in the distribution of firearm suicides. Nationally, the rates of suicide by firearm tend to be higher among older adults, particularly in men aged 65 and older, who often face a combination of health problems, isolation, and mental health challenges. However, the BRHD data suggests that younger men in their teens and early thirties are experiencing suicide rates by firearms that are comparable to older, typically higher-risk populations.\nThe regional data provides insights into the local dynamics of suicide by firearm, revealing not only the patterns that align with national trends but also highlighting the divergences. Given the concerning rise in firearm suicides among younger age groups, there is a need for public health interventions that address the intersection of mental health, firearm access, and age-specific stressors."

We are developing a series of issue briefs intended to identify and distinguish the multiple problems of gun violence to contribute to the community’s work in connecting a range of strategies to the most relevant problems. Recent work has highlighted how distortions in how gun violence is framed or understood has limited the policy conversation.\nThe Gun Violence Clinic is working to support The Center for Community Partnerships’ local data efforts and the Community Safety Implementation Group’s collective work by creating resources for shared community understanding and decision making. As this work progresses, we hope to amplify and share the knowledge of the community. If you believe there is more we should add to this brief or would like to talk to us further, please reach out to Michele Claibourn at mclaibourn@virginia.edu.\nFuture iterations of the Clinic will dive into the research on recommended solutions to unintentional gun violence and how these might be adapted to our context; develop additional issue briefs around other distinct types of gun violence; map the resources, organizations, and programs to reduce gun violence already present within the community; and work with community partners to further expand awareness of the problems of gun violence locally along with solutions. Our work will always be openly shared.\nCover photo credit: Priscilla Du Preez via Unsplash"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) and gun violence are deeply connected issues in the United States. IPV is defined as physical, sexual, or psychological abuse and intimidation of a person by a current or former partner/spouse, whether or not the partner resides in the home. IPV is a distinct subset of Domestic Violence (DV) which encompasses acts of aggression toward any family member, including child or elder abuse as well as intimate partners.1 IPV is widespread, as one-third of women in the United States experience some sort of IPV, and historically marginalized women are disproportionately at risk.2 This brief focuses on the intersection of IPV and gun violence in the United States, focusing on incidents of IPV where a firearm is present as well as cases that escalate to homicide.\nFigure Source: Everytown Research analysis of FBI Supplemental Homicide Report (SHR) data from 2014–2023\nThe harm caused by IPV is amplified by gun violence with the growing use of guns by domestic abusers nationwide. Abusers often use guns to coerce, exert control, threaten, or intimidate victims in situations of IPV. According to a survey by the CDC, almost six million American women report having an interaction with an intimate partner where a gun was used to threaten or harm them.3 Having access to a firearm in the home increases the likelihood that a woman will die in a case of IPV homicide by five times.4 And when guns are involved in an assault, the likelihood of an assault being fatal increases by twelve.5 In short, the ability of an abuser to access a firearm exponentially amplifies the risk of serious injury and Intimate Partner Homicide (IPH), solidifying gun violence as a significant factor to be considered in the broader scope of IPV and IPH."

In many cases, the use of a gun is the final culmination of a long-term abusive interpersonal relationship. Though guns can be used for threats, intimidation, and even physical harm during the early stages or after the relationship ends. Effective policies must therefore not only aim to prevent IPV but also have reactionary interventions in the case of repeated violence."

    "text": "Consequences\nGuns increase the lethality of intimate partner violence, and nonfatal incidents have lasting impacts on survivors as well. When guns are used against victims they are often left with lasting physical impairment, psychological terror, and symptoms of PTSD.12 Guns can be used in relationships to maintain coercive control, to intimidate, and terrorize.13 Women who know of a partner’s use of or access to a gun suffer more severe PTSD symptoms than those who did not endure gun threats.14\nHarm extends beyond the immediate victims. Each death generates a cascade of additional trauma for family members and friends. And the threat of physical harm can spread to new partners, children, family members, pets, and bystanders in cases of firearm-related IPV. Collateral Intimate Partner Homicide is when individuals connected to an IPV victim are murdered. One study found that 70% of such victims were killed by a gun, with the primary victim’s new partner at highest risk.15\nAbusers’ access to firearms also has significant consequences for public safety, as IPV has been linked to mass shooting events in the U.S. A Bloomberg analysis found that 60% of mass shooting events between 2014 and 2019 were carried out in conjunction with or closely related to domestic violence.16 And adolescent IPV has been linked to high-profile school shootings.17"

Controlling abusers often monitor cell phone usage and internet access, barring victims from using any available resources due to fear of firearm use or threat against themselves or others.20 This creates a dilemma for law enforcement and health workers who are working to intervene, as many cases go unreported and they are consequently unable to intervene before IPH occurs.\nMuch like Indigenous, Black, and Latinx women are at heightened risk of IPH, they also face additional barriers to help-seeking and accessing resources. Historical discriminatory practices and fears of continued mistreatment by police and child welfare systems, for instance, reduce the prevalence of help-seeking by minoritized women. Language barriers and immigration threats make help-seeking by foreign-born Latina women more challenging.21"

Gun violence increasingly threatens the health of our communities — particularly for youth and young adults. The greater Charlottesville community has seen an increase in gun violence, threatening the health of individual residents and our communal life. The impacts of gun violence are not confined to those directly involved in violent incidents; the impacts reverberate throughout the community, eroding the collective health of the larger community.\nCommunity gun violence is distinct from other forms of gun violence like accidental shootings, intimate partner violence, identity-based violence, or mass shootings. Community gun violence is commonly understood as interpersonal gun violence that:\nWhile gun violence garners more attention in large urban centers, its presence everywhere is alarming. The incidence of gun violence in Charlottesville and Albemarle County should concern all who live and work in the region. Below we summarize the research on community gun violence - who is impacted, the larger consequences, the root causes - and relate this to what’s happening locally."

    "text": "Who’s at Risk?\nYoung people: Nationally, community gun violence is more likely among youth and young adults.2 In 2020, gun violence became the leading cause of death among youth (under 19 years old).3 According to the Virginia Department of Health’s Office of Vital Records, Virginians aged 18-19 have the highest rate of firearm-related deaths per capita.4 This statistic highlights the urgent need to focus on the challenges facing youth and young adults in the Charlottesville region, particularly in communities where socioeconomic conditions perpetuate cycles of violence.\nCommunities of Color: Nationally, gun homicides disproportionately affect Black, Indigenous, and Latinx individuals.5 While young Black males ages 15-34 made up 2% of the U.S. population in 2021 the death of young Black men accounted for 36% of all gun-related homicides.6 Among children, Black children were far more likely than children of other races to be the victims of gun violence.7\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure Source: JHU8\n\n\n\n\nResidents of Under-resourced Communities: Gun violence is frequently concentrated in neighborhoods with high rates of poverty, few economic opportunities, and a history of disinvestment.9 The risk of gun violence is higher for residents in disadvantaged neighborhoods and those marked by income inequality and residential segregation.10 Racially and ethnically minoritized populations are more likely to live in these under-resourced neighborhoods due to a legacy of structural racism – historic divestment, harmful discriminatory policies, unequal access to quality education – where increased gun violence generates another disproportionate burden.11 In a national survey, over 45% of Black and Latinx Americans believe gun violence is an issue in their neighborhood, while this sentiment was only shared by 27% of white Americans.12"

    "section": "Far-Reaching Consequences",
    "text": "Far-Reaching Consequences\nThe trauma of community gun violence is both physical – death, injury, incarceration – and psychological – PTSD, fear, stress – with impacts on individuals, families, communities, and economies. Youth, in particular, are deeply affected due to their developmental vulnerability.\nDirect Impacts: While lost lives are the most severe harm of community gun violence, gun violence also leaves people injured and traumatized. Gunshots may leave individuals with severe physical injuries, resulting in permanent disabilities, chronic pain, and prolonged recovery periods.13 These injuries limit educational and career opportunities, trapping victims in cycles of poverty and reducing their quality of life. Beyond the individual, gun violence places emotional and financial burdens on families, friends, and caregivers. The long-term rehabilitation needs of survivors often strain relationships and deplete financial resources.14\nIn addition, survivors often face mental health challenges such as PTSD, anxiety, and depression,15 further limiting their educational and economic opportunities and perpetuating poverty and violence.16\nThe trauma of community gun violence extends beyond those who are directly injured to those who are witness to shootings. Constant fear and stress can cause long-term physiological damage, including high blood pressure and weakened immune systems.17 Youth are especially vulnerable; exposure to gun violence can disrupt development and lead to behavioral issues, social disengagement, and higher rates of criminal involvement.18 Children and adolescents who witness violence are particularly at risk for behavioral problems as they attempt to cope with trauma.\nCommunity Impacts: At the community level, gun violence leads to significant social and economic disruption.19 Increased demand for law enforcement, healthcare, and criminal justice services diverts funding from other essential areas like education and mental health. Additionally, rising healthcare costs and long-term care for survivors further burden both the public system and families. The economic costs extend to decreased property values and reduced business activity, weakening local economies.20\nThe psychological trauma caused by gun violence erodes community-level trust and social cohesion, generating what the U.S Surgeon General’s Advisory calls “the collective toll.”21 Communities that are affected by frequent gun violence face collective trauma and a pervasive sense of fear and insecurity.22 Residents are less likely to participate in public life or use communal spaces, weakening social bonds and further isolating individuals.23 This breakdown in trust extends to institutions, as residents may feel disconnected from local governments and authorities, and hesitant to engage with local services.24"

    "section": "Factors that Influence Community Gun Violence",
    "text": "Factors that Influence Community Gun Violence\nCommunity Factors: Economic, racial, and social inequities create and exacerbate the conditions that lead to community gun violence. Areas beset by gun violence are usually facing a variety of challenges around economic hardship: toxic stress, adverse childhood experiences, inadequate and unaffordable housing, underfunded schools, and limited access to health and and social services.25, 26, 27\nThis relationship is underscored by evidence that illegal firearm availability and gun homicide are more strongly correlated in communities experiencing socioeconomic disadvantages.28 Preliminary research suggests income support could reduce the risk of interpersonal gun violence, further highlighting economic insecurity and income inequality as key causal factors.29 The impact of poverty and economic inequities on community violence is no surprise: under-resourced communities have been denied the resources vital to fostering a healthy and safe environment.\nIndividual Factors: Research points to potential individual-level factors that increase the risk of intersecting with gun violence, though many of these are strongly related to an individual’s community context. In a study of boys aged 16 to 19, both school truancy and witnessing non-gun violence were found to correlate with an individual’s likelihood of taking part in gun violence.30 A high future orientation may reduce the likelihood of engaging in gun violence, while a sense of hopelessness about the future increases one’s intersection with gun violence.31 Across multiple studies, however, the most consistent and powerful individual-level predictor of future violence is a history of violent behavior.32"

    "section": "The Local Context",
    "text": "The Local Context\nWhat do we know about community gun violence in the Charlottesville City and Albemarle County region?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile much of the research on gun violence centers on urban areas, gun violence is all too common in small metropolitan and rural areas, like Charlottesville and Albemarle, as well, as analysis from Johns Hopkins shows.33\nData from the Gun Violence Archive, from police reporting, and from VDH reports on firearm injury all point to an increase in gun violence in the Charlottesville-Albemarle region overtime. How do the conclusions from national research – who’s impacted, the larger consequences, and influencing factors – compare to our local context?\nWho’s at Risk\nIn Charlottesville City and Albemarle County, the intersections of age, gender, race, and poverty appear to influence who is disproportionately affected by community gun violence. VDH data on firearm deaths in the broader region points to people aged 18-24 as being at the highest risk. Similarly, the number of gun violence incidences as reported by local police jurisdictions are especially high in neighborhoods with high rates of childhood poverty. The Community Safety Working Group Report as well as several local news stories speak to a focus on Black youth and young men as being more frequently and directly impacted by gun violence.\nThis evidence suggests that the national trends are mirrored here: black male-identifying people under the age of 24 who grew up in neglected and under-resourced regions are most likely to be victims of community gun violence.\nConsequences\nHarm can result from direct or indirect exposure to gun violence and has long-term negative effects on individual wellbeing along with community cohesion and success; these effects are relevant everywhere. The consequences of community gun violence are deep, impermeable, and generational. The trauma of community gun violence is both physical – death, injury, incarceration – and psychological – PTSD, fear, stress – with impacts on individuals, families, and our local communities into the foreseeable future.\nInfluencing Factors\nPast policy choices – residential segregation and racial covenants, massive resistance, the razing of Black neighborhoods, among others – have created under-resourced communities; they do not occur naturally. In Charlottesville, Black residents were disproportionately negatively impacted by UVAs growth as well as by actions of local governments. Communities characterized by disinvestment, with concentrations of residents pushed into economic insecurity, are created by larger policy and systems. Under-resourced communities already confront a lack of economic opportunity. The presence of gun violence adds immeasurably to collective trauma."

We are developing a series of issue briefs intended to identify and distinguish the multiple problems of gun violence to contribute to the community’s work in connecting a range of strategies to the most relevant problems. Recent work has highlighted how distortions in how gun violence is framed or understood has limited the policy conversation.\nThe Gun Violence Clinic is working to support The Equity Center’s local data efforts and the Community Safety Implementation Group’s collective work by creating resources for shared community understanding and decision making. As this work progresses, we hope to amplify and share the knowledge of the community. If you believe there is more we should add to this brief or would like to talk to us further, please reach out to Michele Claibourn at mclaibourn@virginia.edu.\nFuture iterations of the Clinic will dive into the research on recommended solutions to community gun violence and how these might be adapted to our context; develop additional issue briefs around other distinct types of gun violence; map the resources, organizations, and programs to reduce gun violence already present within the community; and work with community partners to further expand awareness of the problems of gun violence locally along with solutions. Our work will always be openly shared.\nCover photo credit: Ézé Amos"

In 2024, the US Surgeon General’s Advisory declared gun violence as a public health crisis3.\nCharlottesville and Albemarle are not immune to the epidemic of gun violence. The rate of violent crime in our community increased by 30% from 2021 to 2022, and in the early months of 2023, police had already investigated five homicide cases compared to zero cases in 20214. On November 13, 2022, three UVA football players were shot and killed on campus. Devin Chandler, Lavel Davis Jr. and D’Sean Perry lost their lives to an act of gun violence. While incidents of gun violence have decreased in the first half of 20245, according to shots fired police reports the number of bullets recovered at each scene has increased, pointing to the ever-changing nature of the issue."

    "text": "Goals\nThe Gun Violence Solutions Project is a University-sponsored effort to work with community partners on assessing, developing, and implementing actionable solutions to reduce gun violence in mid-sized cities and regions, like Charlottesville and Albemarle. One arm of the Gun Violence Solutions Project is focused on researching solutions that could be implemented locally, while exploring law and policy alongside the historical, cultural, and structural factors that shape gun violence.\nThis document is meant to help our community understand the larger picture of gun violence and gun violence trauma in our region by bringing together multiple sources of data. Each section includes an overview of the data source presented, a brief discussion of notable trends, and limitations that may complicate or constrain conclusions.\nThe numbers presented here each represent part of a story. By bringing them together, and in conversation with our community, we hope to collectively tell a fuller story. The community – residents of Charlottesville and Albemarle – is the central stakeholder. The folks who live and work here are the data. Given the wealth of lived experience and the range of perspectives within our community, these voices must be centered. Together we can develop a shared understanding and greater clarity about the local problems of gun violence, identify knowledge and data gaps, and promote wider community engagement in conversations about solutions.\nUltimately, we hope this work will be part of:\n\nUnderstanding the full impact of gun violence on our community and how different people experience this impact;\nWorking with residents, advocates, and decision-makers to identify approaches to prevention and intervention for all types of gun violence; and\nEvaluating the effectiveness of current and future efforts to eliminate gun violence.\n\n\n\nData Notes\n\nThe data provided below represent information that is, for the most part, publicly available. This document is meant to serve as an overview of the existing resources so that we can begin representing the nature, scope, and dimensions of the problem locally.\nMuch of this data relies on information created when people interact with representatives of public services. While reduced to counts and numbers, the experiences and processes the data represent are deeply human. People’s decisions select, record, and shape the data. Though no personally identifiable information is contained in this report, each data point represents a moment in the lives of members of our community.\nThe code and (most of the) data are available at our GitHub repository. We encourage anyone interested to review these analyses or extend them by contributing their own data-driven insights.\nBecause the data below is drawn from various sources – news outlets, the Virginia Department of Health, the US Census Bureau, and local and national law enforcement agencies – we provide a glossary to clarify terminology.\nPlease refer to the Terminology section of the Appendix for more information and a list of definitions."

    "text": "Firearm Injuries & Deaths\nThe leading cause of death by gun violence in the Blue Ridge Health District is suicide, which made up 76% of all firearm-related deaths from 2018 to 2022. This mirrors national patterns, where more than 60% of gun deaths are by suicide6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Notable Trends   The visualization above represents each individual that lost their lives from gun violence in the Blue Ridge Health District between 2018 and 2022, color coded by their cause of death. Of the 141 total lives lost, 107 (or 76%) were by suicide, 31 were homicide, 2 were undetermined or by police intervention, and 1 was accidental. The Blue Ridge Health District includes Charlottesville City, and the counties of Albemarle, Greene, Louisa, Fluvanna, and Nelson. Homicide – community violence, domestic violence, mass shootings, and other intentional violence – accounts for 22% of all deaths. Of all 141 firearm-related deaths between this time period, 68 (48%) were in Charlottesville or Albemarle7.\n\nIf you need to talk, the 988 Lifeline is here.

The bar chart and table below show the rate of firearm injuries per 10,000 emergency department visits in Charlottesville and Albemarle from 2015 - 2024.\n\nBar ChartTable\n\n\nThe bar chart on the left shows the number of firearm-related emergency department visits in Charlottesville and Albemarle over time and the bar chart on the right shows the rate of firearm-related emergency department visits per 10,000 emergency department visits over time. The two peaks, 2020 and 2023, are highlighted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Notable Trends   In 2020, the rate of firearm injuries peaked at 8.3, with 29 firearm injuries among 34,875 emergency department visits. However, 2020 also had the lowest number of emergency department visits which aligns with national trends of decreased emergency department use during the COVID-19 pandemic8. After falling in 2021, the firearm injury rate began trending upward. The year with the most number of firearm-related emergency room visits was 2023, with 35 visits, and the year with the most number of overall emergency room visits was 2024, with 55,578 visits.\n\n\n\nThe table below shows the exact number of emergency department visits in Charlottesville and Albemarle compared to firearm-related visits over time.\n\n\n\nData Source: Virginia Department of Health Firearm-Related ED Visits\n\n\n\n\n\nData Notes\n\nCity/county localities are assigned using the patient’s residential zip code for Virginia residents. Patients with non-Virginia or unknown zip codes are grouped as ‘Out of State.’\nFirearm injury visits are identified using key terms in the chief complaint (reason for visit) and discharge diagnosis codes. Key terms include: gun with wound, GSW, gunshot, buckshot, revolver, rifle, shotgun, firearm, pistol, handgun, been shot, I was shot, I got shot, combination of hit, ricochet, graze with bullet. ICD-10 diagnosis codes: W32.0, W32.1, W33.0, W33.1, W34.0, W34.1, X72, X73, X74, X93, X94, X95, Y22, Y23, Y24, Y35.0, Y38.4 SNOMED diagnosis codes: 41430008, 56768003, 63409001, 69861004, 77301004, 86122002, 111050005, 219257002, 283545005, 218081007, 218086002, 218082000, 218087006, 218088001, 269796009, 242869008, 219199009, 219200007, 219201006, 219204003, 219205002, 219203009, 219198001, 219142001, 219143006, 219144000, 219145004, 219146003, 287184008, 287193009.\nThis excludes follow-up visits, visits involving other types of guns (e.g., staple gun), and visits where firearm was used as a weapon but not fired (e.g., pistol whip).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeaths by Age Group\nThe Virginia Department of Health tracks causes of death among Virginia residents using death certificates and reports on all firearm-related fatalities. Below we show the distribution of gun deaths by age in our region between 2018 and 2022.\n\nBar ChartTable\n\n\nThe bar chart on the left shows the number of firearm-related deaths in the Blue Ridge Health District between 2018-2022, and the bar chart on the right shows the rate of firearm-related deaths per 100,000 people in that age group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Notable Trends   The plot above shows that the rate of firearm death is highest for individuals aged 18 and 19 years old, with a rate of 18.3 based on 8 confirmed firearm-related deaths between 2018 and 2022 in the Blue Ridge Health District. A rate of 18.3 means that for every 100,000 people aged 18-19 living in the region, 18 individuals would have lost their lives to gun violence. While there are fewer than 100,000 residents aged 18-19, the rate helps compare risk of gun-related deaths across age ranges.   The rate above 14 per 100k individuals for all ages between 18 and 44 years old. The age group with the second-highest percentage of gun-related deaths are individuals above the age of 75, with 16 deaths per 100,000 people. Given that suicide is the number one cause of firearm-related death in our region, we assume that a majority of the deaths for individuals 75 and older were suicide.\n\n\n\nThe table below shows the exact numbers of firearm-related deaths in the Blue Ridge Health District between 2018-2022.\n\n\n\nData Source: Virginia Department of Health Firearm-Related ED Visits\n\n\n\n\n\nData Notes\n\nDeaths are classified as firearm-related using the definition from the Centers for Disease Control9.\nVDH reports the number and rate of firearm-related deaths among Virginia residents by patient health district and age from 2018 through 2022. Virginia Department of Health districts are assigned based on the residence of the patient at the time of death, not where the death occurred. Data includes Virginia residents only, regardless of whether they died in Virginia."

    "text": "Incidents of Gun Violence\nThe Gun Violence Archive curates a database of incidents of gun violence and gun crime, sourced from local and state police, media, data aggregates, and government. The database includes information about 213 incidents of gun violence affecting 325 participants in the Charlottesville/Albemarle region from May 17th 2014 - December 31st 2024 along with 13587 incidents affecting 21765 in Virginia from January 1st 2015 - December 31st 2024 . An individual may be involved in more than one incident (see incidents vs. crimes). Incidents range from shots fired reports, to unlawful gun ownership, to acts of violence such as assault and homicide. The Gun Violence Archive does not include information about suicides.\nThe data includes four datasets: one has information about each incident and the associated outcomes (for example, the number of people injured and/or killed), and the other lists participant-level information (for example, the age range and gender of both victims and suspects) for the Charlottesville and Albemarle region along with the entire Virginia Commonwealth. All include the approximate location and date of each incident along with characteristics such the number of injuries, and the nature of the gun incident.\n\nIncidents in CharlottesvilleIncidents in Virginia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Notable Trends   The bar graph above shows that the number of victims both injured and killed in incidents of gun violence have increased tenfold from 3 in 2014 to 33 in 2022. 2022 had the highest number of victims injured, with 24 individuals reported being shot, while 2023 was the deadliest year, with 12 individuals losing their lives to gun violence. While 2024 only includes data through April, so far the numbers are trending lower than in previous years."

The width of each bar represents the approximate percentage of each role by age group. The teal bars on the left show the age ranges of defendants and the purple bars on the right show the age ranges of the victims of gun violence. The width of each bar represents the approximate percentage. Between 2014 to 2024, there were 115 defendants and 81 victims reported. Of the defendants, 29% were between the ages of 20-24, while 19% of the victims were.\n\n\n\nData Notes\n\nThe data does not include any identifiable information about the participants, like name, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or mental health status.\nVoluntary Participation\nBecause the data is sourced largely from public news websites, if an act of violence didn’t receive local news attention it was not included in the Gun Violence Archive database. That means this data underrepresents some information, especially shots fired numbers. Notably, it looks like shots fired incidents haven’t been added to the database since 2021.\nSuicides\nSuicides are not part of the Gun Violence Archive’s normal data collection procedures. Individual suicides are collected through the CDC’s Annual Report10 and, because of privacy and CDC policy, they are only available as an aggregate number, without detail. Suicides associated with Officer-Involved incidents and Murder-Suicides are included in Gun Violence Archive tallies because they are considered incidents of community violence."

The information below is pulled from the Centers for Disease Control WONDER (Wide-ranging ONline Data for Epidemiologic Research) portal. The tables show suicide rates by region, age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Our goal with showing this information is that more more focused attention, and less stigma, is attached to this tragic form of death, and as a result more resources for support can be allocated.\n\n\nData Notes\n\nDeath counts less than 10 are suppressed by the CDC so that individuals cannot be identified. As a result when calculating crude rates, we show a range of values. For calculating percents, we used approximate values. For race and ethnicity estimates, we used the CDC Six Race Categorizations 12.\n\n\n\nSuicides by RegionSuicides by AgeSuicides by Race and Ethnicity\n\n\nThe table below shows the number of suicides in Charlottesville and Albemarle between 2018 to 2023 and the estimated rates per 100,000 people.\n\n\n\nData Source: Centers for Disease Control\n\n\n\n\n Notable Trends  Between 2018 - 2023, there were 55 suicides by firearm in Albemarle County and less than 10 in Charlottesville City. Because the population of Albemarle county is significantly larger, we also look at the rates per one hundred thousand people. In Albemarle, the rate is 8.2 deaths by suicide per 100,000 people, and in Charlottesville the rate is between 0.4 - 3.2. Despite having a larger population, the rate of suicide is still higher in Albemarle than Charlottesville.\n\n\n\nThe table below shows a breakdown of age and gender of the 129 suicides by firearm in the Blue Ridge Health District between 2018 - 2023.\n\n\n\nData Source: Centers for Disease Control\n\n\n\n\n Notable Trends  Between 2018 - 2023, approximately 76% of the suicides by firearm were committed by men, with the ages 15-34 and 65-74 making up the largest percent of victims. This information mirrors national trends concerning sex and suicide by firearms13.\n\n\n\nThe tables below show a breakdown of race, ethnicity, and gender of the 129 suicides by firearm in the Blue Ridge Health District and the 4199 suicides by firearm in Virginia between 2018 - 2023.\nIn the Blue Ridge Health District, the suicide counts for individuals that identify as American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, multiple races, or other races not listed by the CDC was zero, so they are not included in the first table.\nPercentages of Firearm Suicides in the Blue Ridge Health District by Race, Ethnicity, and Sex\n\n\n\nData Source: Centers for Disease Control\n\n\n\nPercentages of Firearm Suicides in Virginia by Race, Ethnicity, and Sex\n\n\n\nData Source: Centers for Disease Control\n\n\n\n\nNotable Trends  The tables above both highlight the trend of white, non-Hispanic males being the prominent victims of suicide by firearm. In the Blue Ridge Health District, white, non-Hispanic males make up 36.8% of the total population, but 80.6% of the total suicides by firearm. In Virginia, the percent of white males males up 30.7% of the total population, but 69.8% of the suicides by firearm.

    "text": "Crimes Involving Firearms\nCrime data for Virginia are pulled from Virginia’s Uniform Crime Reporting - Incident Based Reporting system. The state system follows the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting standards, and the state mandates participation by all publicly-funded law enforcement agencies.\n\nIntimate Partner and Family Violence\nIntimate partner and family violence are a prevalent form of gun violence in the United States, and are often closely linked to firearm accessibility14. Intimate partner violence is defined as abuse or aggression that occurs in a romantic relationship15, and family violence is characterized by abuse or aggression among family members.\nThe tables below show breakdown of sex as it relates to reported incidents of intimate partner violence and family violence with firearms in the combined Charlottesville and Albemarle region and in Virginia between 2016 - 2023. Because many incidents of intimate partner and family violence go unreported, we can assume that many of these numbers are under recorded. For example, according to data collected by the Virginia Sexual and Domestic Violence Action Alliance, 18% of the 23,930 persons receiving domestic violence advocacy services in Virginia in 2023 reported that the perpetrator used a weapon, including a firearm.16\nVictims by Sex of Intimate Violence and Family Violence with a Firearm in Charlottesville and Albemarle\n\n\n\nData Source: National Incident-Based Reporting System\n\n\n\nVictims by Sex of Intimate Violence and Family Violence with a Firearm in Virginia\n\n\n\nData Source: National Incident-Based Reporting System\n\n\n\n\n Notable Trends  The tables above show that in both the Charlottesville and Albemarle regions and Virginia, women are the most common victims of intimate partner violence with a firearm, while men are the most common victims of family violence with a firearm. When a firearm is involved, intimate partner violence is much more deadly. In Virginia, in 2023, 71% of homicides from intimate partner violence were committed with a firearm. This information mirrors national trends17.\n\n\n\nYouth Firearm Rates\nThe data below contains summaries of all crimes where a firearm was used in Virginia, Albemarle County, and Charlottesville City between 2016 - 2023, separated by whether the individuals believed to have committed the crime was an adult or youth. For this source, youth are considered to be under the age of 18.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Notable Trends   The figure above shows the rate of gun violence crimes per 100k population over time broken down by participant age. Statewide, the firearm crime rate has been generally increasing: the adult rate increased from 118 crimes per 100k people in 2016 to 168 crimes per 100k people in 2023 and the youth rate increased from 12 crimes per 100k people to 16 crimes per 100k people. These numbers mean that on average, in Virginia in 2023, for every 100k people, there were 168 firearm-related crimes committed by adults and 16 firearm-related crimes committed by individuals under 18.   Following the COVID-19 pandemic, crimes involving firearms increased for all age groups, most notably among youth. In Charlottesville, the youth firearm crime rate surpassed state levels in 2022. In 2023, however, both adult and youth firearm crime rates decreased.\n\n\n\nData Notes\n\nParticipation\nThe Virginia Incident-Based Reporting system is managed by the Virginia State Police Data Analysis and Reporting Team. Although participation is mandatory, there is the potential for some data loss as each law enforcement agency finalizes their data submission process and data is updated."

    "section": "Police Reporting",
    "text": "Police Reporting\nThis dataset includes an anonymized collection of 890 gun-related incidents recorded by the Charlottesville Police Department (CPD), the Albemarle County Police Department (ACPD), and the UVA Police Department (UPD) between January 1, 2019 - May 18, 2024. The data was retrieved from their SQL database by the ACPD Sr. Crime Analyst, de-identified, and then shared with the Equity Center in June 2024. To preserve anonymity while also providing geographic information, approximate block numbers are used instead of specific addresses. This data is used further below to compare incidents of gun violence to underlying population characteristics.\nEach observation represents the initial information that is provided by individuals calling for police assistance. Some incidents are listed as “Unverified” which means that although a call was made to the police, there was not sufficient evidence to confirm an incident of gun violence actually occurred (see Data Notes section below.)\nAs a result, this is not a definitive collection of public safety data for Charlottesville and Albemarle. These reports likely miss some acts of gun violence as not all incidents are reported to the police. Both personal and structural histories impact individuals’ likelihood of calling the police. In addition, while verified reports indicate evidence of shots fired, they do not mean that an arrest was made.\n\nIncidents of Gun Violence in Charlottesville & Albemarle\n\n\n\n\n\nIncidents of Gun Violence in Charlottesville & Albemarle\n\n\n\n\n\nNotable Trends   The stacked bar plots above show the types of firearm-related incidents in Charlottesville and Albemarle between 2019 and early 2024. While the number of shots-fired reports is higher in Albemarle County, the number of violent incidents such as aggravated assault and homicide is higher in Charlottesville. The distinct geographies contained in each locality likely accounts for some of this difference. For example, shots fired in a rural area of Albemarle County may be a result of wildlife hunting season, while shots fired in an urban area of Charlottesville is typically not associated with legal wildlife hunting.\n\n\n\nAge & Race of Victims of Gun Violence\nThe table below shows the race and age breakdown of the 513 total victims of gun violence (injury and death) reported to the police between January 2019 to May 2024.\n\n\n\nData Source: Verified Anonymized Police Reports\n\n\n\nSome elements of the police data are also available through Citizen Connect, an interface that allows users to view a variety of policing interactions across the region.\n\nNotable Trends   According to the table above, Black individuals make up 55% of the victims of gun violence, but only 11% of the total population in Charlottesville and Albemarle. In particular, Black individuals aged 25-34 comprise 17.2% of the victims. Regardless of race, individuals aged 25-34 make up 27% of all victims.\n\n\n\nData Notes\n\nThere are many limitations to this dataset and as a result we should be cautious when making inferences. Namely:\n\nThis information is neither all-inclusive nor complete. The numbers presented are estimates and only include calls to the police. Not everyone feels comfortable calling the police, and so these may be undercounts.\nThe number of victims is not verified by hospital records (for example, someone going to the hospital for a gunshot wound and reporting it to the police vs. someone calling the police because they think they saw someone get shot — there is no way to differentiate between the two in this dataset).\nWe do not know the precise demographic collection mechanisms used by each officer. For example, we do not know if the race information is self-reported, assumed by the officer, or assumed by a bystander who called for police support.\nEthnicity is not collected, and there is no way of identifying individuals that identify as having multiple races.\nIf an individual is involved in multiple instances of gun violence, they may be recorded in this data set multiple times.\n\nVerification\nEach incident is listed as being verified, unverified, or as a case. An incident is considered verified if it can be proved by an officer to have happened or there is reasonable evidence of its occurrence. For example, a shots fired incident would be verified if there were shell casings found at the scene.\nAn incident would be considered unverified if there was no proof after the fact that it happened. For example, someone may call the police to report hearing loud noises, however when the officers arrived they find either no evidence of a shooting, or evidence to prove otherwise, such as used fireworks supplies.\nAn incident would be marked as a case if it required significant follow up, or was otherwise recorded as a crime to be investigated. Typically more violent incidents such as aggravated assault or homicide become cases.\nData Sharing\nBecause this data may include information that is actively being used in court, it is the only data source in this report that is not fully open-sourced, or publicly available. This decision was made so that the individuals being represented can maintain their anonymity throughout the duration of their trial and subsequent followup. A similar, but more limited, report can be generated based on data availble in the Charlottesville Open Data Portal, and instructions on how to do so are outlined in scripts.R."

    "text": "Charlottesville Open Data Portal\nAnother way of exploring local gun violence data is through the publicly available Charlottesville Open Data Portal. This database includes 526 gun-related crime reports, and 390 gun-related arrests in City of Charlottesville from March 2019 through April 2024.\nThis data differs from the above data, shared directly by the police, in the following ways:\n\nIt includes only reports in the Charlottesville district;\nIt includes all calls to police, not just gun-related calls;\nIt does not include additional incident information such as verification or if it was assigned to a detective as a case.\n\nThe dataset is made up of two dataframes. The first includes information about initial crime report. This data represent the first step when gun-related crimes are recorded; the police-provided data represents the observations after subsequent steps – officer investigation – have occurred. The second data set includes arrest data. Both datasets have been anonymized to remove names and other identifiable information such as house numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Source: Charlottesville Open Data Portal\n\n\n\n Notable Trends   The two maps above show the density of gun-related crime reports and arrests in the Charlottesville region. The map on the left demonstrates that most gun-related crime reports between March 2019 and April 2024 were concentrated in the West Main Street area, specifically near the 10th St intersection. There are also smaller concentrations of reports in Fifeville and on the east end of the Downtown Mall, near the Pavilion.   The map on the right demonstrates that most gun-related arrests are concentrated on the east end of the Downtown Mall, the Roosevelt-Brown Boulevard region, and the south side of Charlottesville. The location with the most arrests is the Charlottesville Police Station, located on the East End of the Downtown Mall. When we asked the police department for clarification, they explained that most arrest warrants are written and filed at the police station, and that when individuals receive warrants, they turn themselves in at the police station. Most incidents of gun violence do not have an arrest at the scene of the crime, but have an arrest days later from a warrant issued, which is issued at the police station.\n\n\nArrest Reports\nFrom the Charlottesville Open Data Portal:\n\n“Arrest data contains information on people taken into custody by City of Charlottesville police officers. More serious crimes such as felony offenses are more likely to result in an arrest. However, arrests can occur as a result of other offenses, such as parole violations or a failure to appear for trial.”\n\nBelow we use the arrest data to understand whether a lot of people are committing a few crimes or a few people are committing a lot of crimes. The figure shows the distribution individuals arrested among the 390 arrests for firearm-related charges made between May 2019 and April 2024. The data has been anonymized so that identifiable information has been removed.\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Firearm-Related Arrests per Person\n\n\n\n\n\nData Source: Charlottesville Open Data Portal\n\n\n\n Notable Trends   Of the 233 individuals arrested, 147 have only one gun-related charge during this five-year period, 53 have two charges, and one person has 15 charges. In other words, 86% of people arrested for gun-related crimes have 2 or fewer charges. This suggests a small group of people are committing a significant proportion of gun-related crimes in Charlottesville.\n\n\n\nData Notes\n\nJurisdiction Limits\nThese datasets only contain information reported by City of Charlottesville Police. It does not contain information about incidents that solely involve other police departments operating within the city (for example, University of Virginia police or Albemarle County police).\nFiltering\nThe data has been filtered to only include crime reports that involve firearms, which required some subjective wrangling. Specifically, only offences labeled Shots Fired/Illegal Hunting, Robbery - Armed, and Weapons Violations are used. As a result, this data may significantly underrepresent the number of firearm incidents. For example, crime reports that have Assault as the primary offense are not included because we cannot be certain the assault included firearm."

    "text": "Use of Force & Officer-Involved Shootings\n\nUse of Force\nIn Virginia, the decision for a police officer to use force requires an analysis of the facts and circumstances of each particular case, including the severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officer or others, and whether the suspect is actively resisting arrest. As a result, this decision is often up to the officer’s immediate interpretation of the scene, and may result in excessive, or deadly, force. Deadly force is defined as any force that is likely or intended to cause serious bodily injury or death, and typically includes the use of firearms, although it can also include batons, rubber bullets, or neck restraints.18\nThe table below shows a breakdown of the 251 incidents of force in Virginia between 2019 - 2023, and whether they resulted in death, serious injury, or if a firearm was used but didn’t result result in death or serious injury.\n\n\n\nData Source: National Incident-Based Reporting System\n\n\n\n\n Notable Trends   In Virginia, the total number of incidents where police used force increased from 40 in 2019 to 60 in 2023. In 2023, there were 23 individuals killed by police, 24 individuals seriously injured, and 13 incidents where a firearm was used by an officer, but didn’t result in death or injury.\n\n\n\nData Notes\n\nParticipation in sharing police use of force information, especially when there is no death, is voluntary, and so the above data may not reflect the total number of incidents in Virginia. The data above also does not indicate what type of force was used, so while firearms are used in most incidents, we cannot assume that a firearm was used in every incident.\n\n\nOfficer-Involved Shootings\nVirginia Law defines an officer-involved shooting as the discharge of a firearm by a law-enforcement officer that results in the death or serious bodily injury of another. 19\nThe table below shows an anonymized version of the 10 victims of officer-involved shootings in Charlottesville and Albemarle from 2016 to today.\n\n\n\nData Source: Gun Violence Archive\n\n\n\n\nNotable Trends   The table above shows the demographic information about the 10 victims of officer-involved shootings in Charlottesville and Albemarle. Of the victims, 40% died as a result of the incident, 50% were identified as Black, and the median age was 37. All of the victims were males that were described as being in possession of a firearm.\n\n\n\nData Notes\n\n Multiple Data Sources   This data is downloaded from the Gun Violence Archive and then manually augmented by reviewing associated news articles for additional information such as age, race, and if the victim had a gun.   Suicide at Standoff   Some of the deaths indicated above were described as self-inflicted, such that they occurred during a police chase or standoff where shots had been fired. These are still considered as officer-involved deaths, because they are still incidents of gun violence. The overall goal is to provide information on most types of gun violence, and gun crime, no matter the root cause."

    "section": "Residential Characteristics",
    "text": "Residential Characteristics\nThe data shown above is focused on describing key outcomes. To better understand the underlying contexts of gun trauma in our community we compare the location of these outcomes to the composition of key residential characteristics that may influence antisocial or violent behavior. It is important to note that many of these residential characteristics do not occur naturally, but are a result of past policy choices such as residential segregation and racial covenants, massive resistance, and the razing of Black neighborhoods, among others that have created the under-resourced communities outlined below.\nThe maps below show clusters of gun violence incidents reported by our local police jurisdictions between 2018 and 2024 overlaid on top of community population characteristics. These characteristics are from the 5-year 2019 - 2023 American Community Survey. The maps show the distribution of population characteristics in our region, such as youth populations, childhood poverty rates, median earnings, and unemployment rates.\nNext to each map is a tab with a scatterplot comparing the presence of a population characteristic to rates of gun violence within each census tract. The population characteristic being examined is represented along the bottom and the proportion of total gun violence incidents from 2018 - 2024 is shown along the side. Each circle represents a different census tract, and the size of the circle is proportional to the population of the tract.\n\nYouth Populations\n\nAre incidents of gun violence happening where there are more youth populations?\nThe map below shows the percentages of young people, defined both as the population that are under 18 and 25 years old, for each census tracts. With over 16,700 undergraduate students coming to the region each semester to study at UVA20, a portion of the 18 to 24 population of Charlottesville and Albemarle is transient. The JPA - Fontaine, Carr’s Hill - McCormick, and Darden tracts house a large number of students, with nearly all first year students living in dorms in the McCormick region. As an alternative, and to focus in on our local youth population, we also show the population under 18.\n\nMapScatterplot\n\n\n\n\nMap Instructions\n\nThe map below shows the percentages of individuals under 18 and 25 years old, respectively. Each grey circle represents a cluster of gun violence incidents. Click on a circle to zoom into the cluster and explore the location and date of each incident. Click on a census tract to see population measurements. Zoom in to see specific areas and incidents more closely. Toggle between the population percentages using the selector in the top right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder 18 Population Percentages Compared to Incidents of Gun Violence\n\n\n\n\n\nNotable Trends   According to the scatterplot above, there is not a strong relationship between the percentage of youth living in a region and the occurrence of gun violence. The regions with the highest proportion of gun violence are Fifeville - Cherry Avenue, 10th & Page - Venable, Ridge Street, Downtown, and Belmont. These tracts are all near the median value of youth proportions, which is approximately 20%.\n\n\n\nData Notes\n\nACS 5 Year Summaries\nThe American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates are summaries for geographic areas that are based on data collected over a five-year period. The ACS data represented here is from 2019-2023. The 5-year estimates are considered more accurate than the 1-year estimates because they use a larger sample size, which results in smaller margins of error.\nJPA/Fontaine\nThe ACS indicates that there are only 14 individuals under the age of 18, all of which are female, living in the JPA - Fontaine census tract. Because of the margins of error for the estimate in this tract, we have removed JPA - Fontaine from the scatterplot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoverty\n\nAre incidents of gun violence happening where there is more poverty?\nThe Census Bureau uses a set of income thresholds that vary by family size and composition to determine who is below poverty. If a family’s total income is less than the threshold for that family’s composition, then every individual in that family is considered to be living below poverty. We use both the percent of the total population below poverty and the percent of children below poverty. For tracts with heavy university student populations, the poverty rate is exaggerated. The child poverty rate excludes the transient low-income status of college students.\n\nMapScatterplot\n\n\n\n\nMap Instructions\n\nThe map below shows the rates of children and adults living in poverty in our region. Each grey circle represents a cluster of gun violence incidents. Click on a circle to zoom into the cluster and explore the location, date, and description of each incident. Click on a census tract to see population measurements. Zoom in to see specific areas and incidents more closely. Toggle between the Overall Poverty Rates and Child Poverty Rates using the selector in the top right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChildhood Poverty Rates Compared to Incidents of Gun Violence\n\n\n\n\n\nNotable Trends   According to the scatterplot above, there is a positive relationship between the percentage of youth living in poverty and the occurrence of gun violence. The census tracts with the highest percentages of youth living in poverty are 10th & Page - Venable, Fifeville - Cherry Avenue, and Ridge Street.\n\n\n\nData Notes\n\nACS 5 Year Summaries\nThe American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates are summaries for geographic areas that are based on data collected over a five-year period. The ACS data represented here are from 2019-2023. The 5-year estimates are considered more accurate than the 1-year estimates because they use a larger sample size, which results in smaller margins of error.\nBecause the data represents summaries from 2019-2023, the plots below do not show changes in poverty rates by individual year but are rather an average of the past 5 years. This information can still be used to estimate approximate poverty rates for 2024, which haven’t been released in the ACS 5-Year Estimates yet.\nStudent Housing\nA significant portion of the JPA-Fontaine Census tract is made up of UVA students. Many of these students are not earning an income and therefore skew overall poverty levels for that area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedian Earnings by Education\n\nAre incidents of gun violence related to low personal earnings?\nEarnings consist of wages and salary from a job, and are the primary source of direct income for most individuals. Other sources of income include Social Security payments, pensions, child support, public assistance, annuities, money derived from rental properties, interest and dividends. Median personal earnings provide a clearer picture of the economic opportunities afforded in an area, as it emphasizes employment income over assets. Lower median earnings are primarily a result of jobs not paying sufficient wages. Median earnings of all employees, of employees with a Bachelor’s degree or more, and of employees with a high school degree only are provided.\n\nMapScatterplot\n\n\n\n\nMap Instructions\n\nThe map below shows the median earnings of each individual by education level. Each grey circle represents a cluster of gun violence incidents. Click on a circle to zoom into the cluster and explore the location, date, and description of each incident. Click on a census tract to see population measurements. Zoom in to see specific areas and incidents more closely. Toggle between the different education levels selector in the top right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedian Annual Earnings Compared to Incidents of Gun Violence\n\n\n\n\n\nNotable Trends   According to the scatterplot above, the three regions with the most gun violence (Fifeville - Cherry Avenue, 10th & Page - Venable, and Ridge Street) all have median annual earnings around $40,000. The only other regions with median annual earnings below $40,000 are Rose Hill - Harris - Venable, Carr’s Hill McCormick Road, JPA - Fontaine, and Old Ivy - Darden School. These blocks also house a significant portion of UVA students, who do not have any reportable annual earnings.\n\n\n\nData Notes\n\nACS 5 Year Summaries\nThe American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates for median earnings are summaries for geographic areas that are based on data collected over a five-year period. The ACS data represented here is from 2019-2023. The data represents the combined responses across all five years.\nMissing Data\nThere are a few tracts where median earnings by specific education level are not available. This generally happens when there are large margins of error in the measurements or very small sample sizes for the tract. As a result the map displays these areas in grey."

The two regions with the highest rates of unemployment, 10th & Page - Venable and Ridge St. - also have significantly high proportions of gun violence. Fifeville - Cherry Avenue, is a notable outlier: although it has some of the highest proportion of gun violence, the unemployment rate is only 1.3, below the regional median of 3.4. Commonwealth - Townwood - Berkmar and Carr’s Hill McCormick Road also have higher rates of unemployment, but lower rates of gun violence."

    "text": "Estimating the Number of Firearms\nRecent estimates put the number of guns privately owned in the US around 392 million21, and over a third of Americans report owning at least one gun22. In 2024, there were 527,538 background checks issued in Virginia for the purchase of a firearm23.\nBecause no license is required to purchase a firearm in Virginia, there is little information on the total number of individuals owning guns or average number of guns per household for Charlottesville and Albemarle. One way to approximate these numbers is to look at a subset of firearm owners: those that have permits for carrying a concealed firearm. Qualified residents are able to apply for a 5-year concealed carry permit through their local circuit courts.24\nAccording to Virginia Circuit Court Caseload Reports, we estimate that there were approximately 561,853 concealed carry handgun permits issued across the state, 842 issued in Charlottesville, and 5387 issued in Albemarle County between 2020 - 2024.\n\n\nData Notes\n\nThe Virginia Circuit Court Caseload reports only show permits for the past 3 years. As a result, used the average number of permits issued per year over the past three years and multiplied that number by 5 to get an estimate for the number of permits issued between 2020 - 2024."

    "text": "Access to Firearms\nThe statistics above demonstrate that guns are easily accessible for many people. Someone can legally purchase a gun from their local big-box store, their neighborhood gun dealer, or a specialty weapons trade show. The minimum age in Virginia to purchase a handgun is 21, however individuals as young as 18 can legally purchase rifles and shotguns25. Residents can open carry their weapons, except in areas where firearms are prohibited by statute (such as UVA Grounds26).\nPeople can also obtain guns illegally: from manufacturing their own, to under-the-table sales, to trade and barters, and theft.\nThis section explores two means of accessing guns in Charlottesville and Albemarle: from the many licensed dealers and from thefts, specifically thefts from vehicles.\n\nFirearms Dealers\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) maintains a record of all federally licensed firearms dealers. Some of these dealers are widely frequented businesses, such as the Walmart on Route 29, while others are individuals that operate out of residential neighborhoods. The list and map below show the 19 authorized dealers in Charlottesville and Albemarle county as of January 2025.\n\nMapTable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocations of Firearms Dealers in Charlottesville & Albemarle\n\n\n\n\n\nData Source: Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives\n\n\n\n Notable Trends   The map above shows that a majority of licensed firearms dealers operate out of businesses in Charlottesville, while there are a handful of residential entities that are licensed to deal firearms in Albemarle county.\n\n\n\nThe type of license issued indicates if the seller is a dealer or manufacturer of firearms and/or other destructive devices like explosives. The sellers in Charlottesville and Albemarle have the following license types:\n\nType 01 - Dealer in Firearms Other Than Destructive Devices\nType 02 - Pawnbroker in Firearms Other Than Destructive Devices\nType 07 - Manufacturer of Firearms Other Than Destructive Devices\nType 09 - Dealer in Destructive Devices\nType 10 - Manufacturer of Destructive Devices, Ammunition for Destructive Devices or Armor Piercing Ammunition\n\n\n\n\nList of all Federal Firearm License types: https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/fact-sheet/fact-sheet-federal-firearms-and-explosives-licenses-types\n\n\n\n\nData Source: Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheft from Vehicles\nThefts from cars are the largest source of stolen guns and have increased triplefold compared to the last decade27.\nAccording to the Virginia Uniform Crime Reporting Database, in 2023 $1,577,221 dollars worth of guns were reported stolen from vehicles in Virginia. Specifically, in Albemarle the amount reported was $20,857, and in Charlottesville, $11,940.\nThe plot below shows the number of guns stolen from vehicles in Charlottesville City and Albemarle County from 2016 to 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheft of Firearms from Vehicles\n\n\n\n\n\n Notable Trends   In general, the rate of firearms being stolen from vehicles has increased, with 48 guns being stolen from vehicles in 2023 in Charlottesville and Albemarle.\n\n\n\nData Notes\n\nTheft data is pulled Virginia’s Uniform Crime Reporting - Incident Based Reporting system.

    "text": "Appendix\n\nTerminology\n\nFirearm Injury\nThe CDC defines a firearm injury as:\n\n“A gunshot wound or penetrating injury from a weapon that uses a powder charge to fire a projectile. Weapons that use a powder charge include handguns, rifles, and shotguns. Injuries from air- and gas-powered guns, BB guns, and pellet guns are not considered firearm injuries as these types of guns do not use a powder charge to fire a projectile.”\n\nTypes of firearm injuries include:\n\nIntentionally self-inflicted\nUnintentional (accidental injuries that happen while someone is cleaning or playing with a firearm)\nInterpersonal violence (homicide or assault)\nLegal intervention (violence inflicted by law enforcement on duty)\nUndetermined intent (not enough information to determine)\n\n\n\nGun Violence\nGun violence is an offense committed with firearms, such as handguns, shotguns, or semi-automatic rifles. It can include homicide, violent crime, attempted suicide, suicide, and unintentional death and injury. The national Gun Violence Archive describes gun violence as:\n\n“all incidents of death or injury or threat with firearms… a shooting of a victim by a subject/suspect is considered gun violence as is a defensive use or an officer involved shooting. The act itself, no matter the reason is violent in nature.”\n\n\n\nGun Violence Trauma\nThe American Sociological Association describes gun violence trauma as the psychological and emotional impact that gun violence can have on individuals and communities. It can result from direct or indirect exposure to gun violence and has long-term negative effects on wellbeing. This information is difficult to objectively measure, so while this analysis focuses on numbers of direct exposure to gun violence for individuals it is important to remember the lasting indirect trauma gun violence has on our community.\n\n\nIncident\nAn incident of gun violence can be defined as a time-boxed event where individual acts of violence took place. An incident may include multiple offenses and individuals involved. For example, if an individual went on a shooting spree and injured three people, that would be considered as one incident with three offenses.\n\n\nCrime\nThe FBI defines gun-related crimes as the number of illegal offenses using a firearm committed during an incident of gun violence. Gun violence is not synonymous with gun crimes. Not all crimes are violent in nature. For example, a person may be charged with the crime of illegally possessing a firearm, despite not brandishing or using the weapon.\n\n\nArrest\nAn arrest can be defined as the physical taking or seizing of a person by a police officer. It is an act that indicates the intention to take that person into custody. An arrest can happen after an incident of gun violence, or it can happen for nonviolent issues such as parole violations or a failure to appear for trial. Anyone arrested is considered innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.\n\n\nParticipant\nA participant is defined as an individual involved in an act of gun violence. Participants can be victims, those injured or killed by firearms, or offenders, those using firearms. In cases of suicide, participants are considered victims. It is important to note that while the definition is limited to individuals that are physically affected by gun violence, the spectrum of victimization often extends much further to the community.\n\n\nYouth\nFor this analysis, youth are considered to be juveniles under the age of 18. Some visualizations include individuals up to 24 years old as noted in the description."

    "text": "Officer-involved shootings refer to incidents where a law enforcement officer discharges a firearm during an encounter with civilians, resulting in injury or fatality. Officer-involved shootings are a subset of use of force incidents.1 Reporting requirements for these incidents vary by state. In Virginia, the General Assembly amended the Code of Virginia to require law enforcement agencies to report officer-involved shootings that result in death or serious injury to the Virginia State Police within 48 hours,2 reflecting growing concern about excessive use of force by police and the need for greater accountability. Virginia’s policy mandates reports to include details such as the location, circumstances, and identities of those involved.3\nThe scale of officer-involved shootings is unclear, as data on these events is not systematically captured. From 2015-2024 the Washington Post maintained a database of police shooting incidents after determining that no government agency keeps reliable data.4 In 2019, the FBI initiated the National Use-of- Force Data Collection, though participation in the effort is voluntary.5 Nevertheless, a national survey estimates there are over 3,500 officer-involved shootings annually in the U.S.6 Review of incidents captured by media reports reveals those killed in officer-involved shootings has steadily increased since 2017,7 rising to 1,173 incidents in 2024.8 While officers face situations that justify the lawful use of, potentially lethal, force, the growing number of injuries and lives lost raises urgent concerns. Recent polling found that 61% of Americans lack confidence that law enforcement officers are adequately trained to prevent excessive force.9 Many officer-involved injuries and fatalities represent preventable losses, and the increasing rate raises concern at both the individual and institutional levels."

    "text": "Who is Impacted?\nOfficer-involved shootings disproportionately harm members of minority communities, men, and young adults.\nBlack and Hispanic communities endure a disproportionate share of police use of force incidents. Black Americans, which comprise only about 14% of the national population, are more than twice as likely, compared to white counterparts, to be shot by police.10 Results from the Police-Public Contact Survey, part of the National Crime Victimization Survey, suggest that Black and Hispanic residents were twice as likely as white residents to experience the threat of physical force in police-initiated contacts (5.2% and 5.1% compared to 2.4%).11\nGender imbalances are also significant. Over 95% of victims in officer-involved shootings are male. Men are not only more likely to be approached by officers (12%) compared to women (9%), but they also face a higher likelihood (4.4%) of experiencing the threat or use of physical force than females (1.8%).12 Age also plays a crucial role. Young adults, those 20-39 years of age, face the highest frequency of officer shootings.13\nThe disproportionate impact of officer-involved shootings on Black and Hispanic communities, young adults, men, and individuals of low socioeconomic status underscores the systemic inequities embedded in modern policing practices.14 Many of these disparities are linked to historical legacies, structural biases, and discretionary enforcement practices that continue to shape law enforcement interactions.15"

    "text": "Enduring Consequences\nOfficer-involved shootings impact those directly involved, including the officers, as well as the larger community.\nImpacts on Victims and Communities\nOfficer-involved shootings result in devastating consequences for victims, their loved ones, and the communities they belong to. Survivors often suffer life-altering injuries, long-term trauma, and financial instability due to lost wages, medical costs, or funeral expenses. Families of those killed in police encounters endure profound grief, exacerbated by the struggle with navigating opaque legal systems, seeking justice, and overcoming barriers to accountability.\nMore broadly, affected communities, especially Black and Brown communities, experience deepening distrust of law enforcement.16 While the killing of George Floyd in 2020 sparked national and global protests, every incident of an officer-involved shooting has the potential to highlight systemic racial disparities in policing and reinforcing the collective trauma felt by many marginalized groups.17 A 2022 survey found that about half of surveyed Black people would prefer to be robbed or burglarized than to have unsolicited contact with police.18\nFear of police encounters reduces public cooperation with police, making crime prevention and public safety efforts more difficult. The erosion of trust in law enforcement after an incidence of police violence harms service provision and community safety.19 Research has documented a significant decrease in 911 calls after police-involved shootings,20 especially in communities of color.21\nImpacts on Involved Officers and Policing Institutions\nFor officers involved in shootings, the personal consequences can be profound. Officers who discharge their weapons in policing encounters may experience post traumatic stress disorder and other psychological responses that diminish overall well-being.22 This cumulative stress may result in chronic health issues, poor job performance, and challenges in maintaining a healthy work-life balance.23\nIn addition to declining trust, police departments may face increased political scrutiny and operational challenges in response to officer-involved shooting incidents, requiring capacity to be redirected.24 Officer-involved shootings frequently become flashpoints for national and local political discourse, including calls for institutional change."

    "text": "What Do We Know About Officer-Involved Shootings?\nThe absence of consistent and complete data on OIS has limited research into the underlying causes of the increase in police shooting incidents.25 Researchers have long lamented the inability to analyze when and why officer-involved shootings occur or to systematically evaluate potential interventions,26 and efforts to compile data both inside and outside of government channels has been incomplete.27\nNot only is the true scope of these occurrences unknown, the lack of transparency undermines public confidence in police accountability. Without clear, standardized reporting practices, public skepticism intensifies, and law enforcement is left with diminished incentives to adopt or enforce comprehensive use-of-force policies. Legal doctrines such as qualified immunity and limited civil liability further complicate accountability. Although these protections are intended to shield officers from constant litigation, they also reduce the pressure on law enforcement to ensure transparent practices and adopt reforms.\nAccountability measures, such as independent oversight boards and transparent disciplinary processes, play a critical role in deterring misconduct. Internal investigations are often inaccessible to the public, and disciplinary actions are often undisclosed.28 As there seems to be little recourse when abuses occur, community mistrust builds from low-information. While these procedures support institutions’ autonomy and officers’ privacy, the low availability of information largely removes civilians from effectively engaging in this process."

Half of of these victims were identified as Black, and the median age was 37 years old.29"

    "text": "Unintentional shootings are a major public safety concern resulting in roughly 520 fatalities1 and at least 27,000 injuries2 annually. While fatalities due to unintentional shootings are comparatively low – accidental shootings comprised about 1.3% of all gun deaths in 2021 – they account for 37% of all non-fatal gun injuries.3 By any metric, unintentional firearm injuries represent a significant and preventable public safety issue that warrants urgent attention.\nUnintentional shootings, sometimes called accidental shootings,4 occur when someone is struck by a bullet that wasn’t fired at them on purpose. Unintentional gun injuries may occur because an individual handling a gun does not realize it is loaded or does not know how to properly hold a gun, discharging it by accident. Or an individual may fire a gun deliberately and without intent to harm but with carelessness of their surroundings. Unintentional shootings can occur when individuals are “playing” with guns or when they’ve been drinking alcohol. Unintentional gun violence affects both children and adults, often in a home environment.\nThe various circumstances surrounding unintentional discharge makes distinguishing between an intentional and unintentional shooting challenging.5 It also highlights the value of approaching gun violence from a public health perspective, rather than from a criminal justice and legal perspective, to place focus on the underlying risk factors to eliminate unintentional gun death and injury by implementing evidence-based prevention strategies."

Among men, Black men aged 20 to 34 are the most likely group to die from unintentional shootings.8\nWhile women and girls experience far fewer unintentional shootings, among female victims, young Black women and girls – those aged 0 to 19 – are the most likely group to die by this type of violence.9\nYoung people: Overall, children aged 10-19 are at the highest risk of death by unintentional firearm injury.10 While the number of unintentional shootings by children was relatively stable between 2015 and 2023,11 rate of unintentional shooting by children aged 0-5 is on the rise.12 Children living in homes with easy access to unsecured firearms are at greater risk.13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStates with weaker gun laws: More than half of all individuals who die by unintentional gun injuries live in the south. Southerners are three times more likely to die by unintentional gun injuries than their northeastern counterparts.14 Researchers point to weaker gun violence prevention laws in the south as a primary reason for this discrepancy.15"

    "section": "Factors That Increase Risk",
    "text": "Factors That Increase Risk\nEasy Access: Access to and availability of firearms is a primary cause of unintentional shootings, especially for children; the risk is aggravated by unmonitored access to firearms in the home. The access that children, or young adults, have to a gun at home directly impacts the chances that this gun may be mishandled, leading to an unintentional shooting.16\nUnsafe Storage: An estimated 54 percent of gun owners do not lock all of their guns securely.17 Among gun deaths of children, the firearm used was most frequently stored in an unlocked location and loaded.18 Carrying a gun outside the home increases the chances that the gun will be left unsecured.19 And as the gun industry has made firearms lighter and easier to use, children are more likely to mistake them for toys.20\nImproper Training: Nearly one third of unintentional firearm deaths occur because a gun was not being handled properly while about one fifth involved someone believing a loaded gun was unloaded.21 Both of these behaviors stem from a lack of knowledge on how to operate a gun safely.22 Children, of course, are especially unlikely to have formal training on gun safety.\nA review of research on the effects of gun safety training found few consistent effects on people’s behavior with guns, but notes that the effectiveness may depend on the content of training, motivation of participants, and the credibility of the trainer to participants.23 Nevertheless, some states have begun experimenting with requiring firearm safety training for gun purchasers.24\nAdditional contributing factors: Alcohol is another risk factor. Among people aged 20-29 who were victims of an accidental shooting, 46.8% of cases involved alcohol.25 Older adults suffering from dementia or related conditions may also be at higher risk of an accidental shooting, especially given the high rate of gun ownership among adults aged 65 and older.26"

The physical and mental health toll can impact education, employment, and substance use.27 Medical incidents and costs can extend beyond the initial shooting if individuals are readmitted to a hospital, as occurs for approximately 10% of firearm survivors.28 Individuals and families bear the financial and emotional burden of medical care and rehabilitation, which can drain resources and contribute to financial instability.29\nBecause most unintentional firearm injury occurs under conditions of low threat – when individuals are handling guns for routine activities and without intent to harm – unintentional shootings are often understood as private tragedies. The impact on those impacted, though, can be severe; these are not inevitable consequences of gun ownerships. Prevention measures are available."

    "text": "The Local Context\nWhat do we know about unintentional shootings in the Charlottesville City and Albemarle County region?\nThe data around unintentional firearm injuries and deaths are especially incomplete. Injury data is believed to contain error due to underreporting, if victims don’t present at an Emergency Room, and overreported, if victims report an intentional shooting as accidental. Fatality data, too, suffer from misclassification, with both true accidents recorded as homicides or suicides and intentional gun fatalities reported as accidents.30 The limitations of the data structure around gun injury and harm make it challenging to evaluate unintentional shootings at the local level.\nWhile data from the Gun Violence Archive reports only four accidental shootings in the region between 2021 and 2023, this is limited to incidents either recorded by law enforcement or reported by media sources.31 If national patterns hold, unintentional shootings could account for 30% or more of the 300-plus firearem injuries the Virginia Department of Health reports for our region in the last six years.32 Among the four local reports of unintentional shooting in the Gun Violence Archive, all involved adults and one resulted in a death.\nVirginia has long made it unlawful for a gun owner “to recklessly leave a loaded, unsecured firearm” within ready access of a child under the age of 14,33 but has no law that requires unattended firearms to be stored in a certain way. There is also no state law requiring firearm training for gun purchases. These, though, are only a few of the strategies proposed to reduce the occurrence of unintentional gun injury and death."

If you believe there is more we should add to this brief or would like to talk to us further, please reach out to Michele Claibourn at mclaibourn@virginia.edu.\nFuture iterations of the Clinic will dive into the research on recommended solutions to unintentional gun violence and how these might be adapted to our context; develop additional issue briefs around other distinct types of gun violence; map the resources, organizations, and programs to reduce gun violence already present within the community; and work with community partners to further expand awareness of the problems of gun violence locally along with solutions. Our work will always be openly shared."
